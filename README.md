# xcode-register

A small tool that registers all your installed Xcode plugins.

## Introduction

`xcode-register` is created to automate the repeated labor of adding the Xcode
plugin identifier `DVTPlugInCompatibilityUUID` into all my plugins' `Info.plist`
files. Previously I used a shell script but that script is not reentrant. This
small Objective-C program does exactly that, however it is reentrant and can be
fairly robust.

## Installation

Copy and paste the following shell script into a Terminal windowto install or
update `xcode-register`:

    curl -L https://github.com/xcvista/xcode-register/raw/master/xcode-register-install.sh | bash

## Usage

The simplest way of using `xcode-register` is to let it register all existing
plugins of the current user to the default installation of Xcode, by running:

    xcode-register

If you need to register the plugins to some other versions of Xcode, for example
a beta version installed at `/Applications/Xcode-beta.app`, run this:

    xcode-register --xcode /Applications/Xcode-beta.app

Execute this for complete instructions of `xcode-register`:

    xcode-register --help
